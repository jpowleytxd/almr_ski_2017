    <h1 class="main_title">Ski Overview</h1>
    <p class="standard_text">La Plagne has become something of a home-from-home for French skiers, loyal family groups returning each season. The British also seem to have taken it to their hearts over the years, not least since there's something for all tastes and skiing abilities here. As in Les Arcs, the primary focus is on intermediate family skiers, who have countless areas to head off to and enjoy.</p>
    <p class="standard_text">Experienced skiers are seduced by the sheer scale of the Paradiski linked-domain experience, but the simple fact is that La Plagne's own terrain is already huge and arguably more multi-faceted than that of its neighbour, with strong appeal to skiers of all levels. There's not only a wealth of gentle terrain for novices and early-intermediates but also a good variety of higher-altitude Red and Black-graded pistes (along with departure-points for off-piste excursions) designed to satisfy more experienced skiers.</p>
    <p class="standard_text">Those who like to get around will find plenty to explore beyond Belle Plagne and the crest of L'Arpette (2385m), from which the choices include heading up to the Roche de Mio to ski on the glaciers of La Chiaupe and Bellec&ocirc;te â€“ even in July and August. Topping off at 3250m, this is La Plagne's highest terrain. On the other hand, there are long cruises through the tree-line to Les Coches (1450m) and Montchavin (1250m), either direct or via Les Bauches (1800m). And that's without taking the Vanoise Express link (which you'll pass just above Montchavin) across to Peisey-Vallandry and Les Arcs.</p>
    <p class="standard_text">The ALMR Ski trip will be based at Belle Plagne, sitting at 2050meteres it is situated just above Plagne Bellecote. The resort, as the name might suggest, is one of the prettier Plagne centres and consists of chalet style architectures. It also provides excellent ski in &amp; out experiences.</p>
